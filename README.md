• The UI displays a list of the user’s Twitter followers in a grid.
• Clicking on the date filter field should display a date popup from which the user may select a From date and a To Date.
• The buttons under “Sort By” section could be a toolbar or button group. Clicking once sorts the grid in ascending order by that criteria. Clicking again sorts the grid in descending order by that criteria. Clicking on one criteria, deactivates the others.
